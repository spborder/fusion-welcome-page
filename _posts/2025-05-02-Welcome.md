# Background

## Spatial --Omics Data

Spatial --omics data greatly expands the ability of researchers to pose complex hypotheses surrounding the spatial distribution of genomic markers. Compared to bulk sequencing, spatial --omics techniques focus on the preservation of where a particular signal is derived from relative to other signals in the same experiment. This data allows for testing colocalization of certain --omics (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, etc.) with other characteristics of a dataset as well as relational properties to other areas of a sample.

## Histopathology

Histopatholoy is a sub-field of pathology wherein disease is studied in the context of microscopic examination of tissue structures. This can include a wide array of different scales from light microscopy to electron microscopy to better understand physical determinants of disease.
